# nth-Bottls-of-Beer-on-the-Wall
A simple While Loop for the popular 99 Bottles of beer on the while

By using simple Variable assignments to the int variable x the while loop was able to iterate through each number by decrementing x for each iteration out printing the lyrics to the song 99 bottles of beer on the wall.  
The if statement within the while loop tested whether or not x was equivalent to 1 and once it was it was able to change the lyrics from 'beers' to 'beer' and also decremented x leaving x to be 0.  
Since x was no longer less then zero the program was able to exit the while loop
